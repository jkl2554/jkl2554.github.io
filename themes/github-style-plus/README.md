## Demo

First, take a look at my [blog](https://blog.kurtstories.com/), it's the completely demo for this theme.

## Usage

### Init hugo site

```bash
hugo new site mysite
cd mysite
```

### Install the theme

```bash
git submodule add git@github.com:kurt-liao/github-style-plus.git themes/github-style-plus
```

### Update the theme

If you just installed the theme, it is already in the latest version. If not, you can update using the below commands

```bash
cd themes/github-style-plus
git pull
```

Then, you need to rename the previous `posts` folder to `post`

```bash
cd <you-project-folder>
mv content/posts content/post
```

## New featuresâœ¨

### Pinned posts and recent posts show together

In the original version, only one of *Pinned* block and *Recent* block will be shown.
In this version, both blocks will display together.

### Display your real github followers stats

To show real github followers count, please set `enableGithubFollowers = true` and your github account like `github = kurt-liao` in *config.toml* file.

### Add sponsor link button

Set your sponsor link in **config.toml** like `sponsorLink = "https://www.buymeacoffee.com/vermouth02D"` and the button will show on the page.

For me, I put the [buymeacoffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/vermouth02D) link.

### Keyword search locally

Searching in personal site might be important with a growing number of articles.
This feature uses hugo rss that generate `index.xml` feed file, so make sure you have set `params.rss = true`
Since somebody might not want to use this feature, there's another parameter you need to set to true to enable: `params.enableLocalSearch = true`

### Show more button

For the speed of page loaded in the first paint, I decide to hide most of posts when the page first loaded.

### Update old Google Analytics to GA4

Since the old Google Analytics is being retired. I've change the old GA code to GA4.

### Support GTM Script

Apart from Google Analytics, we may also want to add GTM Script.
To do this, just add `gtmId = "xxx"` in your *config.toml* file

### Custom organizations block

You may want to set some custom organizations except Github, Twitter, Facebook...
Therefore, I've add the custom organization block for you to do so.
The settings in *config.toml* might look like this:

And the effect would look like:
